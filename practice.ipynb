      "There is no  more powerful input than digital technology to drive the world’s economic output  This is the core thesis for our being as a  company, but it’s  not enough  As we  drive global economic growth, we must also commit  to creating a more inclusive,  equitable, sustainable, and trusted future     Support inclusive economic growth    We  must  ensure  the  growth  we  drive  reaches  every  person,  organization,  community,  and  country   This  starts  with  increasing access to digital skills\n",
      "To help address this, we’ve committed to skill and recruit 250,000 people into the US cybersecurity workforce by 2025— especially those underrepresented in the field  And we’re helping an additional 24 countries with substantial cybersecurity  workforce shortages close their gaps too     We also continue to deliver affordable, relevant cloud technology and industry-specific solutions to nonprofit organizations  addressing the world’s most pressing issues  This year, we provided $3 2 billion in donated and discounted technology to  302,000  nonprofits  serving  over  1\n",

      "Despite  these increases, we remain dedicated to achieving a net-zero future  We recognize that progress won’t always be linear,  and the rate at which we can implement emissions reductions is dependent on many factors that can fluctuate over time     On the path to becoming water  positive, we invested in 21 water replenishment projects that  are expected  to  generate  over 1 3 million cubic meters of volumetric benefits in nine water basins around the world  Progress toward our zero waste  commitment included diverting more than 15,200 metric tons of solid waste otherwise headed to landfills and incinerators,  as well as launching new Circular Centers to increase reuse and reduce e-waste at our datacenters\n",
      "We advocate for strong  privacy  laws  that  require  companies,  including  ours,  to  be  accountable  and  responsible  in  their  collection  and  use  of  personal  data   That’s  why  we  supported  the  new  Trans-Atlantic  Data  Privacy  Framework  and  committed  to  meet  or  exceed  all  the  requirements  it  outlines   And  through  the  Microsoft  privacy  dashboard,  millions  of  people  each  year  can  make meaningful choices about how their data is used     Security and digital safety  are foundational to trust in today’s complex threat landscape  We analyze 43 trillion  security  signals daily and use the insights to inform increased protections\n",

      "Over  the  past  few  years,  I’ve  written extensively about  digital transformation, but now  we need  to go beyond that to  deliver  on what I call the  “digital  imperative ”    Technology  is  a  deflationary  force  in  an  inflationary  economy   Every  organization  in  every  industry  will  need  to  infuse  technology  into  every  business  process  and  function  so  they  can  do  more  with  less   It’s  what  I  believe  will  make  the  difference between organizations that thrive and those that get left behind     In the coming years, technology as a percentage of GDP will double from 5% to 10% and beyond, as technology moves  from  a  back-office  cost  center  to  a  defining  feature  of  every  product  and  service\n",
